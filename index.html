    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the
        Internet
        through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[1] It allows documents
        and
        other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol
        (HTTP).[2]
        The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the
        public in
        1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[3][4] Documents and other media content are
        made
        available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and
        resources
        on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators
        (URLs).
